## Provided Contracts

### [Minter Collection](ligo/src/minter_collection)

Customizable smart contracts for minting FA2 NFTs as collections.

### [Editions FA2](ligo/src/minter_collection/editions)
The _Editions_ variant of FA2 allows for the minting and distribution of many editions of an NFT that share the same metadata, but with unique identifiers (`token_id`s). The design of this contract also allows for the minting of many editions runs in O(n) (where n is the number of editions runs minted) and concurrent distribution of editions across multiple creators.

### [English Auction](ligo/src/english_auction)

An implementation of an English auction marketplace that allows users to initiate auctions of NFTs in either tez or FA2 tokens.

### [Fixed Price Sale](ligo/src/fixed_price_sale)

An implementation of an NFT marketplace that allows users to initiate NFT sales at a fixed price in tez or FA2. These contracts can be configured based on a range of administrative options.

### [FA2-FA2 swaps](ligo/src/swaps)

An implementation of a swaps contract that allows two participants to safely exchange their FA2 tokens.
There is a whitelisted extension that allows specifying the permitted set of FA2 contracts involved.

### [Ticket-based NFTs](ligo/src/tickets)

**EXPERIMENTAL** An implementation of NFTs using tickets and a dutch auction example, along with wallet contracts for the NFTs. _Please note: tickets are a new Tezos feature and care should be taken when using them as they have not been heavily tested in production._

### Work-in-progress contracts

#### Meta-transaction based minting / sales ([WIP](https://github.com/tqtezos/minter-sdk/pull/33))

#### Fractional Ownership ([WIP](https://github.com/tqtezos/smart-contracts/pull/57))

#### Royalties and Profit-splitting ([WIP](https://github.com/tqtezos/minter-sdk/pull/40))


# Local Development

## Prerequisites

You'll need these.

- [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

- [`tezos-client`](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/1-tezos-client/)

## Package Scripts

Package scripts are managed and invoked by `yarn`.


### `yarn compile-ligo [filter]`

Compile LIGO contracts to Michelson. 

Accepts an optional filter which compiles _only_ those contracts matching the given filter string. 

E.g., 
```bash
yarn compile-ligo fa2_swap
```

If no filter is given, all contracts will be compiled.

**Arguments**

| Argument   | Position    | Description                                                | Required |
| --------   | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------  | -------- | 
| `[filter]` | `0`         | Compile _only_ contracts matcing the given filter string   | 🔘        |


**Options**

| Option | Alias               | Description              | Required |
| ------ | ------------------- | -----------------------  | -------- | 
| `-s`   |`--src-path`         | LIGO source path         | 🔘       |
| `-o`   |`--out-path`         | Michelson output path    | 🔘       |

One may also pass the `help` command to see a list of options in their terminal.
```bash
yarn compile-ligo help
```

> This script delegates LIGO compilation to `docker` — ensure the docker daemon is running for it to execute correctly.

### `yarn michelson-to-ts`

Converts compiled Michelson contracts to exportable TypeScript modules. Requires [`tezos-client`](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/1-tezos-client/) binary to be available.

E.g.,
```bash
yarn michelson-to-ts -c tezos-client
```

**Options**

| Option | Alias               | Description                                                                                          | Required |
| ------ | ------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              | -------- | 
| `-c`   |`--client-path`      | Path to `tezos-client` binary. If installed in `$PATH`, simply passing `tezos-client` will suffice.  | ☑️        |
| `-m`   |`--michelson-path`   | Path to compiled Michelson folder                                                                    | 🔘       |
| `-o`   |`--out-path`         | TypeScript output path                                                                               | 🔘       |
| `-E`   |`--endpoint`         | HTTP(S) endpoint of the node RPC interface; e.g. 'http://localhost:8732'                             | 🔘       |


One may also pass the `help` command to see a list of options in their terminal.
```bash
yarn michelson-to-ts help
```

> This script will _not_ compile LIGO contracts beforehand. Be sure to execute [`yarn compile-ligo`](#yarn-compile-ligo-filter) first if you need updated contract code.

### `yarn bootstrap` 
Bootstrap the network specified in `ENV_NAME` environment name.
Check if the contract addresses in the config file are actually deployed on
the network. If necessary, re-deploy compiled contracts and update the config
file.

### `yarn bootstrap-sandbox` 
Bootstrap flextesa sandbox network.

### `yarn bootstrap-testnet`
Bootstrap flextesa test network.
