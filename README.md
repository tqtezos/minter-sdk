## Notice

This software is in beta. At the moment, the smart contracts
that OpenMinter uses have **not** been formally audited. Please
use this software at your own risk.

## Minter SDK

Minter SDK is a set of tools and libraries to bring all functionality
around the creation, management, and sales of NFTs to any application. 

The Minter SDK will contain various functions, such as:
- Contract definitions and tests
- An NPM module that allows users to interact with tokens programmatically
- A CLI that brings SDK functions to the command line

## Implemented FA2 Contracts

### [English Auction](english_auction)
An implementation of an English auction marketplace that allows users to initiate auctions of NFTs. There are (as of writing this) 
two versions of this contract: one with administration capabilities and one without. For now, in the positive case, this means that
a configured administrator is responsible for configuring and managing access to important entrypoints. 
### [Fixed Price Sale](fixed_price_sale)
An implementation of an NFT marketplace that allows users to initiate NFT sales at a fixed price. There are multiple flavors of this contract that vary along two variables: admin capabilities, and NFT sale type (fungible tokens/tez).
### [Minter Collection](minter_collection)
Implementations of various token types.

## [Ticket NFTs](tickets)  

**EXPERIMENTAL** An implementation of a dutch auction using ticket based NFTs, along with wallet contracts for the NFTs. *Tickets are a new Tezos feature and care should be taken when using them as they have not been heavily tested in production.*
